# Epic Todo List

This is a react repo exploring different ways to manage `state` and `props` for a todo list.

## Prop Drilling
- As a user I should be able to modify a parent component's state using a child component form.
- As a user I should be able to see the parent component state update.
- As a user I should be able to avoid unnecesary refreshes.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`# todolist
